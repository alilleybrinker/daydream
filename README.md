# daydream

The goal of the `daydream` crate is to enable syncing in-memory data
to SQLite with ease, for applications that want to add some degree
of persistence with minimal effort or worry. The tradeoff here is that
you don't get much control over how the layout is done (though `daydream`
will be designed to be reasonably fast and predictable in terms of
syncing behavior), but that it's very easy to integrate.

__NOTE: This crate is not yet implemented, it is purely a concept being
designed around at the moment.__
